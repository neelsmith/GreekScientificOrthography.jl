# Large values


## Using integer values in hexadecimal units


::: {.callout-note title="TBA"}

An alternative to tedious sums of fractions:

- divide whole units into sixtieths, seconds (3600ths), thirds (216000ths)... each written with an integer value up to 59
- typically used in tables where columns determine meaning of integer
- but manually written columns make null values dangerous if they're left blank, so adds special character `Ο` (οὐδέν, "nothing") for 0.
