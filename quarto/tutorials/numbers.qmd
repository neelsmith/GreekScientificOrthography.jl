# Evaluating numeric values

`GreekScientificOrthography` includes the `milesian` function for parsing Greek numbers in Milesian notation into numeric values.

See [this guide](../guides/numbers.qmd) for full documentation of the Milesian notation
recogized by `GreekScientificOrthography`.

## Integers

Integer values are identified with the numeric tick, `Õ¥`.
```{julia}
#| warning: false
using GreekScientificOrthography
milesian("Œ¥Õ¥")
```

```{julia}
milesian("Œ∫Œ¥Õ¥")
```

Thousands are separated by a comma from lower-value digits.

```{julia}
milesian("Œ±,Œ±Õ¥")
```


## Fractions

Fractional are written as unit fractions values given by the reciprocal value and tagged with a double-prime marker.


```{julia}
milesian("Œ¥‚Ä≥")
```

```{julia}
milesian("Œ∫Œ¥‚Ä≥")
```

Other values have to be expressed as the sum of a series of unit fractions. Two-thirds can be written as 1/2 + 1/6, for example.

```{julia}
milesian("Œ≤‚Ä≥ œõ‚Ä≥")
```


You can of course mix integers and fractions.

```{julia}
milesian("Œ≤Õ¥ Œ≤‚Ä≥")
```

`GreekScientificOrthography` includes three special characters often used in Greek manuscripts for the values 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4.

```{julia}
milesian("êÖµ‚Ä≥")
```

## Myriads

The basic notation lets you write integers up to 9,999.

```{julia}
milesian("Œ∏,œ°œôŒ∏Õ¥")
```

10,000 is written with upper-case mu, for "myriad".


```{julia}
milesian("ŒúÕ¥")
```

It's treated as a distinct token. As with fractions, the value of the string expression is the sum of the tokens.

```{julia}
milesian("ŒúÕ¥ Œ±,Œ±Õ¥")
```

Myriads can be multiplied! In  `GreekScientificOrthography` this is indicated with a Markdown superscript expression (enclosed in carets).

```{julia}
milesian("Œú^Œ≤^")
```


A myriad myriads is 10^8^!

```{julia}
milesian("Œú^Œú^")
```

The biggest integer value we can write in this system is 100009999.

```{julia}
milesian("Œú^Œú^ Œ∏,œ°œôŒ∏Õ¥")
```
