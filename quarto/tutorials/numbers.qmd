# Formatting numeric tokens


Manuscripts of Greek scientific and mathematical texts use the "Milesian" system of numeric notation.

In version `0.1.0` of `GreekScientificOrthography`, integer values from 1 to 9,999 in this notation are correctly tokenized.

## Integers in the "Milesian" system of notation

The Milesian system is essentially a place-value system.  The 27 values for ones (1-9), tens (10-90), and hundreds (100-900) are noted with specific alphabetic characters in normal alphabetic order, with the additions of `ϛ` for 6, `ϙ` for 90 and `ϡ` for 900.


- ones, tens, hundreds: alphabetic characters followed by the Greek numeric marker 'ʹ' (Unicode `x0374`).
- comma separates thousands
- myriad (10,000) is upper-case mu, Μ
 


Summary of the Milesian system:
