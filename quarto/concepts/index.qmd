title: The orthography of Greek math and science

```


The center point of this package is the `GreekSciOrthography`, a concrete subtype of the abstract  `GreekOrthography` type (from the [`PolytonicGreek`](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/polytonicgreek/) package).


## Characters

To the familiar alphabetic character set of the `LiteraryGreekOrthography` type, `GreekSciOrthography` adds:

- astronomical symbols for planets and zodiac signs that commonly appear in astronomical texts

```{julia}
GreekScientificOrthography.astro()
```


- the non-alphabetic characters used to write numeric values in Greek mathematical and scientific texts



```{julia}
GreekScientificOrthography.numeric()
```


## Token types

In addition to recognizing lexical and punctuation tokens, a `GreekSciOrthography` can tokenize text into astronomical symbols, numeric tokens in the Milesian notational system, and labels for figures in mathematical texts.



```{julia}
o = stemortho()
tokentypes(o)
```

```


In version `0.1.0`, integer values in "Milesian notation" up to 9,999 are tokenized as `MilesianIntegerToken`s, and astronomical symbols are tokenized as `AstronomicalSymbol`s.



::: {.callout-note title="In progress"}
Support for tokenizing fractions and larger integer values  is planned for the next release.
:::


- semi-case-sensitive
- recognizes scientific symbols: astronomical glyphs, numeric markers


## Types

- figure labels: tokenization treats all-uppercase tokens < some length as label types for figures
- milesian integers:
- milesian fractions
