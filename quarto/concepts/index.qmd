title: The orthography of Greek math and science

using GreekScientificOrthography
```


The centerpiece of this package is the `GreekSciOrthography`, a concrete subtype of the abstract `GreekOrthography` type (from the [`PolytonicGreek`](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/polytonicgreek/) package).


## Characters

To the familiar alphabetic character set of the `LiteraryGreekOrthography` type, `GreekSciOrthography` adds:

- astronomical symbols for planets and zodiac signs that commonly appear in astronomical texts

```{julia}
GreekScientificOrthography.astro()
```


- the non-alphabetic characters used to write numeric values in Greek mathematical and scientific texts



```{julia}
GreekScientificOrthography.numeric()
```


## Token types

In addition to recognizing lexical and punctuation tokens, a `GreekSciOrthography` can tokenize text into astronomical symbols, numeric tokens in the Milesian notational system, and labels for figures in mathematical texts.



```{julia}
o = stemortho()
tokentypes(o)
```

Astronomical symbols are represented by single Unicode codepoints such as `ðŸœšï¸Ž`, "sol".


In contrast to the other token types, the syntax of numeric values and mathematical figure labels is case-sensitive.

Integer values in the Milesian notational system are written using 27 alphabetic or archaic alphabetic characters, followed by the numeric marker 'Í´' (Unicode x0374).  (See a [tutorial on writing numbers](../tutorials/numbers.qmd).)  A comma separates digits for ones, tens and hundreds (to the right of the comma) from digits for thousands (left of the commma). `ÎœÍ´` is the value for "myriad," 10,000. `Î¼` is the digit for 40.

Mathematical figure labels are defined as strings of upper-case purely alphabetic characters, without any breathing or accents.  The string `á¼©` is a lexical token (the nominative feminine singular of the article, in upper case), while `Î—` is a figure label, "eta". 


## Work in progress

Support for tokenizing fractions and integer values greater than  9,999 is planned for the next release.
